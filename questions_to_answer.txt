Were mitigation measures followed by a drop in mobility? If yes, was there a delay?
- Calculate delay based on certain threshold dropoff in mobility 
- How to calculate what a corresponding drop is? Maybe lowest point in a 7 day look-ahead window?
- group by mitigation type, compare min, avg, max values

Which mitigation measures had the greatest effect on mobility?

Frequency of mitigation measures per state?
- Calculate average time in between each mitigation measure given for each state. Will show how often a state's government is communicating with the public.

Which state listens the least or takes the longest to listen to mitigation measures?
- Find the frequency (count the number of times) where the delay of a state (calculated by the mobility dropping below it's average) takes longer than it's average. This will show which state listens the least to it's government and which governor's words seems to have the least amount of power. Could be caused by a variety of factors in a state such as public governor approval rates, poverty levels and technology accessibility, literacy rate, population density,etc.
